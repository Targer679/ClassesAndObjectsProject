This project is about many different peretions with dates, using classes, objects and methods. This projects gave me the first experience of working with classes 
and made me understand that classes, objects and methods can really make coding more efficient and easy. An output compiles through class Calender, and you can see how execute methods 
properly in the examples provided in main branch.
